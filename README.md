status.mc-api.net
=================
A mongo based minecraft server tracker

I use this to show player counts of popular servers as well as user-submitted servers at [status.mc-api.net](http://status.mc-api.net)

Requirements
-------------
* A working (MongoDB)(http://mongodb.org) database

***This won't work 'out of the box' you will need to tinker around and setup your mongo connection. I use a file called ```mongo.php``` which is out of public view***
